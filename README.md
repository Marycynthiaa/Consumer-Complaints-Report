# Consumer Complaints Report
## Project Background
This project focuses on analyzing consumer complaints submitted to financial institutions. The dataset is illustrative and may not reflect actual values. It captures real world issues reported by individuals regarding products and services such as credit reporting, debt collection, mortgages, and banking.

**The objective** of this analysis is to uncover patterns in complaint frequency, identify the most problematic products and evaluate how effectively complaints are being addressed.
Using Excel, key insights were derived through PivotTables, visual charts, and time based aggregations to support trend analysis and performance benchmarking.
This analysis provides valuable transparency into the financial sector’s customer service practices and can be used by stakeholders to improve consumer protection strategies.

## Data Structure

### Data Cleaning
To ensure consistency and accuracy in the dataset, several data cleaning steps were performed. Date inconsistencies were resolved by standardizing the format across all date fields, enabling accurate time-based analysis. The Find and Replace tool was used to correct state abbreviations and misspellings, ensuring compatibility with Excel’s geographic mapping features. Next step involved standardizing text fields by converting all entries to proper case for consistency in grouping categories like Product, Issue, and mode of submission.
 

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Overview of Findings
The analysis reveals persistent issues within the financial services sector, with consumer complaints largely centred around checking/savings accounts and credit card products. Common issues include difficulties in managing accounts, disputes over unauthorised charges, and dissatisfaction with unclear or excessive fees.

A significant spike in complaints occurred in 2023, particularly in August, likely influenced by macroeconomic pressures such as inflation and rising interest rates, which may have increased consumer sensitivity to charges and repayment terms. However, there was a marked decline in complaints by 2024, potentially reflecting improved regulatory compliance, better customer service practices, or easing financial strain.
Across all categories, consumers expressed frustration with lack of transparency, poor communication, and slow or ineffective resolutions. These findings point to systemic issues in how financial institutions handle account access, billing, and complaints resolution.
The insights from this report underscore the need for more proactive complaint monitoring, greater clarity in fee structures, and enhanced customer service protocols to rebuild consumer trust and reduce recurring issues.

### Products offered by Company
Most complaints were concentrated in two key product categories: checking/savings accounts and credit cards. Within these categories, consumers frequently reported issues related to account management, such as opening, closing, or accessing accounts. Surprisingly, many also faced problems with unauthorized charges by lenders or third-party services, as well as unexpected fees, interest charges, and difficulties in obtaining or using credit cards.
- Problems with managing their accounts, such as login/access issues, unauthorized transactions, or system errors.
- Confusion or dissatisfaction with billing practices, especially regarding late fees, penalty interest, or unclear promotional terms.
- These recurring themes highlight a broader concern around transparency, unauthorized access, and poor communication from financial institutions.

### Yearly Complaints growth

The year **2023** saw a sharp surge in consumer complaints received by the company, with **August** recording the highest volume. The remaining months of the year maintained relatively stable complaint levels. Interestingly, there has been a notable decline in complaints from 2024 onward, compared to the peak in **2023** and the preceding two years. New financial regulations or policies may have encouraged more consumers to report issues as well as financial stress during 2023 (e.g., inflation, interest rate hikes) which might have led to more disputes over fees, credit limits, or loan terms especially around mid-year in 2023 and by 2024, some of these pressures may have been erased.

### Recommendations
- Improve Customer Onboarding and Account Management Processes then streamline the procedures for opening and closing accounts to reduce friction and miscommunication.

- **Enhance Transparency Around Fees and Charges:**  Review and simplify fee structures for savings, checking, and credit card products by ensuring all charges (e.g., overdraft fees, interest, third-party transactions) are clearly disclosed and easy to understand.

- **Monitor Complaint Trends Proactively:** Set up monthly reporting dashboards to track complaint volumes by product, issue type, and channel and use these insights to track early detection of customer dissatisfaction.


## Tools and Skills

### Automation: VBA for Navigating Between Report Pages
To improve user experience and streamline report navigation, a VBA macro was created to allow users to switch between different sheets (report pages) with a single click via icons.
This added visual layer improved the dashboard’s readability and helped for easy navigation in one click.
