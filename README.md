# Consumer-Complaints-Report
### Project Background
This project focuses on analyzing consumer complaints submitted to financial institutions. The dataset is illustrative and may not reflect actual values. It captures real world issues reported by individuals regarding products and services such as credit reporting, debt collection, mortgages, and banking.

**The objective** of this analysis is to uncover patterns in complaint frequency, identify the most problematic products and evaluate how effectively complaints are being addressed.
Using Excel, key insights were derived through PivotTables, visual charts, and time based aggregations to support trend analysis and performance benchmarking.
This analysis provides valuable transparency into the financial sectorâ€™s customer service practices and can be used by stakeholders to improve consumer protection strategies.
